# Lenovo-ThinkCentre-M700-OSX-Sonoma-on-Skylake
Opencore configuration to run OS X Sonoma on a (i5) ThinkCentre M700 Skylake SFF PC.
{under construction}

## Specifications:
- I5-6400t 1.2G (Skylake) with 8Gb RAM
- Intel® HD Graphics 530
- BIOS version 7/2022 [FWKTBFA](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/desktops-and-all-in-ones/thinkcentre-m-series-desktops/thinkcentre-m700-tiny/10hy/downloads/ds105487-flash-bios-update-intel-b150-for-thinkcentre-m700-tiny-thinkcentre-m800-m900-m900x-tiny?category=BIOS%2FUEFI) 
- Has locked MSR2 (CFG Lock var offset = 0x197, and must be [unlocked](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/misc/msr-lock.html#what-is-cfg-lock))
- Intel wifi (with Broadcom bluetooth)
- Display connected to the DP connector closest to the power supply (con2?)

## Brief guide:

- download the EFI.zip, expand it and update your serial number with GenSMBIOS (for a MacMini8,1)
- note that the uncompressed EFI folder is for review only and is missing Tools and Resources (don't copy it to the EFI partition, instead use the expanded EFI.zip)
- should be bootable (OC 0.9.5 and up-to-date kexts)
- the individual non-compressed folders are provided for guidance (of particular significance is config.plist, which lists the DeviceProperties and NVRAM boot args, along with [Misc:Boot:Hibernation](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/355419-90-solved-hibernatemode-25-successfully-working-on-intel-hd-630-igpu-but-glitch-issues-on-first-wake-screen/) setup)

## Miscellaneous (but important) notes:
This is a sweet little machine, took me a while to run Sonoma and then stumbled on the infamous wake-from-sleep issue with its HD 530 iGPU. No way I would accept a non-sleeping computer, so took it upon myself to solve the problem - essentially trying laptop-specific advice from OSXLatitude and insanelymac forum users. Seems it's working (fingers crossed). 
- WOL works, with the included Mausi driver (v1.0.8)
- use powerbutton to wake
- the USB ports were mapped with CorpNewt's scripts under an iMac19,1 SMBIOS, and then edited to reflect the current MacMini8,1
- Hackintool reports iGPU as "???", and I don't know the significance of this
- bluetooth is reported as present, but haven't bothered to check if it works or not (probably won't be reliable)
- the zipped ready-to-use EFI does not include Audio resources and other themes (to save space); please download if required
