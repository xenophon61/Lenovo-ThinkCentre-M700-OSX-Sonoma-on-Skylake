# Lenovo-ThinkCentre-M700-OSX-Sonoma-on-Skylake
Opencore configuration to run OS X Sonoma on a (i5) ThinkCentre M700 Skylake SFF PC.

## Specifications:
- I5-6400t 1.2G Skylake
- IntelÂ® HD Graphics 530
- BIOS version 7/2022 FWKTBFA 
- Has locked MSR2 (CFG Lock var offset = 0x197, and must be [unlocked](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/misc/msr-lock.html#what-is-cfg-lock))
- Intel wifi (with Broadcom bluetooth)
- Display connected to the DP connector closest to the power supply (con2)

## Brief guide:

- download the EFI.zip, expand it and update the serial number with GenSMBIOS
- note that the uncompressed EFI folder is for review only (don't copy it to the EFI partition, instead use the expanded EFI.zip)
- should be bootable (OC 0.9.5 and up-to-date kexts)
- the individual non-compressed folders are provided for guidance (of particular significance is config.plist, which lists the DeviceProperties and NVRAM boot args, along with [Misc:Boot:Hibernation](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/355419-90-solved-hibernatemode-25-successfully-working-on-intel-hd-630-igpu-but-glitch-issues-on-first-wake-screen/) setup)

- this post applies to the HD 630, but was used as a template for the HD 530 on the ThinkCentre; genious approach!
